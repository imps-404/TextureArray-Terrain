# TextureArray-Terrain
I made this shader for unity default terrain.

It's a material surface shader with some cool effects like Parallax occlusion map, gradual snow.

It does use texture array so you will need support for that.

You will need a script to fill in the infos needed, like snow coef, the texture array, etc.
