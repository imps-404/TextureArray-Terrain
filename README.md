# TextureArray-Terrain
I made this shader for unity default terrain.
It's a material surface shader with some cool effects like Parallax occlusion map, gradual snow.
It does use texture array so you will need support for that.
You will need a script to fill in the infos needed, like snow coef, the texture array, etc.
